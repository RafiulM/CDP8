# Tech Stack Document - CDP8

Technology Stack for CDP8  
=========================  
Below is a breakdown of the key technologies, tools, and practices in use (or implied) by the CDP8 repository. Wherever possible, version information is given and the primary purpose of each component is noted.

1. Programming Languages and Versions  
   • C (ISO C99-style)  
     – The vast majority of code is in C (“.c” and “.h” files).  
     – Used for high-performance digital signal processing (DSP) routines, file I/O, and command-line interfaces.  
   • C++ (pre-C++11 / C++98 style)  
     – A small number of files in externals (e.g., fastconv’s .cpp, paprogs) use basic C++ for FFT wrappers and utilities.  
     – No modern C++ features (STL, templates) are heavily employed.  
   • Shell / Makefile syntax  
     – Legacy Makefiled.osx files (simple BSD-style Make).  
   • Tcl/Tk (Sound Loom integration)  
     – Conditional compilation with the `sloom` macro for embedding into the Sound Loom graphical environment.

2. Frameworks and Libraries (with versions)  
   • CMake (3.0+ recommended)  
     – Cross-platform build system: orchestrates compilation, linking, install/uninstall, platform checks.  
     – Found under top-level `CMakeLists.txt` and `cmake/` modules (e.g., CompilerOptimizations.cmake).  
   • PortAudio (≈19.07 or later)  
     – Cross-platform audio I/O library used by `paplay`, `pvplay`, `recsf` for real-time playback/recording via callbacks.  
   • FFTW (3.x) or rFFTW  
     – Fast Fourier Transform routines for spectral analysis, convolution, and phase vocoder operations.  
     – Wrapped by custom “mxfft.c” and fconv-fftw.cpp in externals.  
   • libaaio-0.3.1  
     – Nonblocking keyboard-input library (optional component).  
     – Packaged under `libaaio/`.  
   • portsF (custom)  
     – Header/library `portsf.h` and `portsf.c` provide cross-format sound file reading/writing (WAV, AIFF, raw).  
   • sfsys (custom)  
     – Sound File System library for `.ana`, `.pvx`, and other CDP-specific file formats.  
   • externals/reverb (Schroeder/Moorer)  
     – Third-party nested allpass filter reverb code under `dev/externals/reverb`.  

3. Database Technologies  
   • None  
     – All metadata and parameter data are stored in plain text, command-line arguments, and in-memory C structures.  

4. Infrastructure and Deployment Tools  
   • Cross-platform support via CMake generators:  
     – Unix Makefiles, Xcode (macOS), Visual Studio (Windows).  
   • Install/uninstall support via generated CMake targets (`cmake_uninstall.cmake.in`).  
   • Packaging:  
     – Source distribution as tar.bz2 (e.g., libaaio).  
     – No containerization or orchestration manifests present.  

5. Development and Build Tools  
   • CMake (minimum 3.x)  
     – Central build configuration.  
   • GNU Make / BSD make  
     – Driven by CMake-generated makefiles or hand-crafted Makefiled.osx.  
   • Command-line toolchain: gcc/clang on Linux/macOS, MSVC or MinGW on Windows.  
   • Editor integration:  
     – Syntax conventions follow classic K&R/C99 styles.  
   • Static code analysis (community recommendation)  
     – Tools like clang-tidy, cppcheck, or Coverity for memory/safety checks.  

6. Testing Frameworks and Tools  
   • None included  
     – No unit tests, integration tests, or test harnesses shipped.  
     – Testing is manual: running individual command-line tools on audio files.  

7. Monitoring and Observability Tools  
   • None included  
     – Runtime debugging via verbose error messages in `errstr`.  
     – No built-in logging frameworks; uses `sprintf`→stdout/stderr.  

8. Third-party Services and APIs  
   • Sound Loom (Tcl/Tk)  
     – Optional GUI front-end integration through the `sloom` compilation flag.  
   • PortAudio API  
     – For real-time audio callbacks and device enumeration.  
   • FFTW API  
     – Planning and executing FFTs for spectral transforms and convolution.  
   • System APIs  
     – POSIX threads (pthreads) on Unix/macOS; Windows threads on Windows.  
     – Standard C library (libm for math, stdio, stdlib).  

9. Security Tools and Practices  
   • Licensing:  
     – GNU LGPL 2.1 for core CDP code, ensures freedom to modify/link.  
   • Input validation:  
     – Extensive command-line parameter checks (`check_*_param_validity`) to guard against out-of-range values.  
   • Manual memory management scrutiny:  
     – Careful `malloc`/`free` patterns with error checking (`goto` cleanup) to mitigate leaks/crashes.  
   • Recommended best practices (not codified):  
     – Replace `sprintf` with `snprintf` to avoid buffer overflows.  
     – Run Valgrind or ASAN for heap/stack checks.  

10. DevOps and CI/CD Tools  
    • Version Control: Git (hosted on GitHub)  
      – `.gitignore` present.  
    • No CI configuration files (e.g., GitHub Actions, Travis CI) are shipped.  
    • Suggested pipeline (community recommendation):  
      – Automated builds on Linux/macOS/Windows via GitHub Actions.  
      – Static analysis and memory-leak detection stages.  
      – Producing binary packages (tarball, ZIP) upon release.  

Summary  
-------  
CDP8 is a large, performance-oriented, command-line suite written in C (with small C++ pieces) for advanced audio processing. Its build relies on CMake for cross-platform compilation, and it integrates key DSP libraries such as FFTW and PortAudio. While there is no database, testing framework, or CI/CD pipeline included, the codebase employs manual parameter validation, memory-management discipline, and LGPL licensing. For modernization, adding automated tests, CI pipelines, and improved static analysis would strengthen maintainability, security, and cross-platform reliability.
